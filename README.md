# Processing the Wikidata dataset
This repository is a collection of scripts to pre-process a dump Wikidata. All
the code was tested with the *latest-truthy* dump of Wikidata (June 9th, 2024).

## Filters
The first step is to apply some filters to the dump in order to reduce redundant
or unnecessary triples

### Filter 1: Remove labels and descriptions
This filter is aimed to remove descriptions of Subjects/Objects in multiple
languages, leaving only the English description

```sh
python remove_labels_and_descriptions.py < [input .nt file] > [output .nt file]
```


### Filter 2: Remove properties
This filter removes all the properties not starting with
"<http://www.wikidata.org/prop/". As a byproduct, this filter generates a file
named `removed_properties.txt` with all  properties removed.

```sh
python remove_properties.py < [input .nt file] > [output .nt file]
```

### Filter 3: Remove invalid edges related to containment relations/predicates
This filter removes all the triples that are invalid according to a containment relation. The script is intented to work only with
containment-related predicates, where a cycle can be considered as an error or a bug. However, the code is general enough
to be applied to other predicates. The filter works in two steps: 1) First, perform DFS traversals starting from at the vertices with in-degree 0, and 2) For all vertices not visited during the first step, perform a DFS traversal starting at an arbitrary vertex. As a byproduct, this filter generates a file named `removed_triples_cycle.txt` with all triples removed.
The list of predicates to be considered is given as an input file following the format
```
   <predicate 1> <direction>
   <predicate 2> <direction>
   ...
 ```
where `<direction>` indicates how to interprete the triple SPO (0: S--P-->O, 1: O--P-->S). The direction is used, in particular, for predicates related with
the containment relation. For an example, check the file `containment_predicates.txt`

```sh
python delete_cycles.py --input <input .nt file> --output <output .nt file> --subset-preds <.txt file with the subset of predicates>
```
## Summary
To apply all the filters to the Wikidata dump *latest-truthy.nt*, use

```sh
cat latest-truthy.nt | python3 remove_labels_and_descriptions.py | python3 remove_properties.py > latest-truthy_filtered.nt

python delete_cycles.py --input latest-truthy_filtered.nt --output latest-truthy_filtered_nocycles.nt --subset-preds cycle_predicates.txt
```

| Dataset                   | Number of triples  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| latest-truthy (original)  | 8,254,120,518      |
| After filter 1            | 2,276,362,123      |
| After filter 2            | 1,617,500,079 (26 properties deleted)      |
| After filter 3            | 1,615,616,023 (1,884,056 triples deleted)      |

## Continuous identifiers 
The second step is to convert the filtered dataset into a new version using
continuous identifiers for the subject/objects and predicates. The output
dataset has extension `.nt.dat`. Additionally, two dictionaries are generate to convert identifiers to entries of
the filtered dataset, one for subjects/objects (extensi√≥n `.nt.dat.SO`) and one
for predicates (extension `.nt.dat.P`)

```sh
python continuous_ids.py --input <input .nt file>
```

## Statistics
This script computes some stats from the input .nt file, as a graph. In
particular, the computed stats are:
- in-degree and out-degree distribution (saved at in-out-degree.png file). By default,
  a histogram of the whole graph is generated, but we can limit the maximum degree using
  the option `--max-deg`
- Top 10 in-degree and out-degree nodes (i.e. subjects or objects)
- Number of triples with predicate belonging to different subsets of
predicates. The subsets are given as an input file following the format
```
   #Subset1
   <predicate 1>
   <predicate 2>
   ...
   #Subset2
   <predicate 1>
   <predicate 2>
   ...
```
For an example, check the file `sets_predicates.txt`

```sh
python get_stats.py --input <input .nt file> --subset-preds <.txt file with the subset of predicates> --max-deg <limit degree>
```
### Stats from subsets of containment and adjacency relations 
- Frecuency of predicates [`P150`](http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P150) and

relation) (filter 1 + filter 2): 14,520,899

[`P131`](http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P131) (representing containment

- Frecuency of predicate [`P47`](http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P47)
